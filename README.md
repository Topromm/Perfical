# Perfical
A personal financial calendar that helps you track income, expenses, and upcoming payments at a glance.

## From Spreadsheet to App: Why I Built Perfical
I've always been a highly analytical person, which is why I spent years tracking my finances in Excel using custom formulas and conditional logic. It worked, but it was far from perfect. That's where Perfical comes in — a Personal Financial Calendar designed to make it effortless to watch your spending, balance changes, and upcoming payments at a glance.
